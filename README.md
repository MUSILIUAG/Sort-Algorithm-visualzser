## Introduction

This project provides a simple visual representation of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Selection Sort using SDL for graphics rendering.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- SDL library
- SDL_image library

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sdl-sorting-visualization.git
   cd sdl-sorting-visualization
2. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
   g++ main.cpp -o sorting_visualization -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image

## Usage
Run the compiled executable:
./sorting_visualization

Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a sorting algorithm and observe the visualization.




## Sorting Algorithms
The project currently supports two sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort

## Dependencies
SDL 2.0
SDL_image 2.0
